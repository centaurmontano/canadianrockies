# canadianrockies.github.io
My debut website is a sleek and responsive travel guide to the stunning Canadian Rockies. This project showcases my passion for CSS and web development with its lightweight design and seamless Bootstrap 5 integration. It’s fully responsive without relying on jQuery and offers easy customization through a variables.css file. The website features smooth scroll animations, clean code, Google fonts, and an off-canvas mobile menu for enhanced user experience. It’s optimized for SEO and performance, making it a perfect fusion of aesthetics and functionality.”
